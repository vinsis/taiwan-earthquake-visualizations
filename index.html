      <h3>Representing sum of magnitude per year using color</h3>
      <p>Darker the color, higher the sum total of magnitude of earthquakes for that given year.
      It gives a quick idea of which years suffered higher magnitudes. <br>
      Click on any year to see more details.

      <h3>Monthly pattern of earthquakes</h3>
      <p>The below illustration shows how intensity of earthquakes has varied across months. Such an illustration quickly exposes temporal patterns, if any.</p>

      <h3>Depth vs Magnitude</h3>
      <p>We want to find out if there's any correlation between depth and magnitude of earthquakes. We can easily see most earthquakes take place at larger depth but those of larger magnitude take place at (relatively) shallower depths.</p>
